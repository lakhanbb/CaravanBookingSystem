# CaravanBookingSystem

The motivation for the Vacation On Wheels project stems from a passion for travel and camping combined with the identification of gaps in the industry and market demand. The goal of the project is to innovate technologically, build community, fulfill business goals, and promote environmental awareness. Subjective experiences and a desire for social impact further drive the project, making it an opportunity to gain experience and apply practical knowledge.
